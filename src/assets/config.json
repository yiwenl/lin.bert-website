For this occasion we built a 9ft dome in which we mapped out the night sky. During the evening, guests could draw their own constellation, name it and attach a message to it. Their creation was then immortalised in the installation. We also added sounds so that each interaction would trigger various musical notes, transforming the whole installation into a giant synthesizer.",

The installation was projected on a massive screen and each child had a chance to interact with the installation. Additionally they could draw their own constellation which was then projected during an evening event.<h2 class='top'>OFF / DDD Milan 2016</h2>We were very honoured to be part of the first edition of the digital festival DDD Milan 2016, in which SÙ was displayed.
